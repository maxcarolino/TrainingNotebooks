    "This notebook discussed several topics related to objects, from language-defined variables, single inheritance to multiple inheritance, to required, default and optional as well as starred arguments/keyword arguments, and some uses of the super() function. Each of the examples can easily be translated to real-life examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might consider using star arguments/keyword arguments pattern for high inter-operability with other objects while limiting the required knowledge about them. You will also find that methods that use this are easier to work with while letting data flow through an application. This pattern is common in mature frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some example classes that could be in use within various parts of an example application. We don't know how they are being implemented but we are sure that the code won't break because new arguments need to be added. Other objects may be subclassing them, inheriting their properties and calling their methods, but our code will continue to function."
