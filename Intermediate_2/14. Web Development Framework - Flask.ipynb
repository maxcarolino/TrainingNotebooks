    "\n",
    "As much as I want us to dive into web development right away, we need some background information about what's happening behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web is basically people's computers talking to other computers at global scale. When you _surf online or the 'net/web_, you're actually instructing your computer to talk to another computer, usually using your browser. This is possible because there's already agreement on how these computers find each other, how to know if a computer can talk about something, if it will talk to them, and how to talk to each other if and when they reach this point. At each step, there are technologies and protocols that allow this to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python to teach our computer to respond to other computers that request your website. Right now, it's enough to know that we'll be communicating over Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP. We'll teach our computer how to respond when another computer makes a requests our site.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [WSGI](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there is a standard called Web Server Gateway Interface or WSGI that describes way for web servers, applications or frameworks to communicate. Flask will handle this for us. It's good to know about this because most frameworks implement WSGI but we won't go deep about it. You can look it up on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a micro webdevelopment framework for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a better grasp of what you can do with Python, we'll start doing more exciting things like building a website. There are other frameworks but we'll be using the micro framework called Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask depends on two libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/documentation/) - an HTTP and WSGI utility library for Python.\n",
    "* [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/) - a templating engine, and\n",
    "\n",
    "I mentioned WSGI earlier. Under the hood, the Werkzeug library handles it for us so we don't do it manually. I also mentioned HTTP. We'll send documents written in Hypertext Markup Language or HTML over HTTP. We are using the Jinja2 library to make things easier."
